==========
Turrentine
==========

Turrentine is a simple content management app for Django (1.3 and later).

What, *another* CMS app? Yes, but I tried several before deciding that I couldn't
find one with a few more features than flatpages, but not much more.

Turrentine is:
--------------

* Simple: very little code, and few features by design.
* Dependency-free, unlike some other "basic" CMS apps that still require you
  to pull in 3-5 other packages.
* Easy on the database. A user viewing a CMS page should never generate more
  than one or two performant database queries.
* Kind of a half-way point between Django's basic flatpages app, and other simple
  third-party CMSes like gnocchi-cms. Both apps served as a starting point for
  turrentine.

Things Turrentine does **not** do:
----------------------------------

* Tree-like page hierarchies. Like flatpages, with turrentine you just specify
  the page's URL directly.
* WYSIWYG editing
* File uploads in the admin (add something like `django-adminfiles`,
  `django-admin-uploads`, or `django-filebrowser` if you need that).
* Auto-generated menus
* Template editing in the admin
* Multi-site support
* Commenting on pages
* Internationalization (although this might be worth adding later)
* Automatic versioning of content (although adding hooks for django-revision
  would be interesting)

Consider Turrentine if...
-------------------------

* You don't need any of the stuff in the previous section
* You want a simple CMS app that is easy to configure, and for the most part
  just gets out of your way.
* You have page authors who are comfortable writing html, but you don't want
  them to have to write (or even think about) django templates.
  You have developers/designers that develop your templates for the CMS.


Setup
=====

#. Install turrentine. Pip is recommended and can be used as follows::

    pip install -e git://github.com/af/turrentine.git#egg=turrentine

#. Add 'turrentine' to your installed apps in settings.py::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # Your other apps here
        'turrentine',
    )

#. Add turrentine at the **end** of your root urlconf::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # Your other urls go here

        (r'^', include('turrentine.urls')),     # Make sure this is the last entry
    )

#. If you haven't already, you probably also want to enable django's dev static
   file serving in your `urls.py`. This will ensure that turrentine's admin css/js will work
   while in development::

        from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns

        # ... the rest of your URLconf here ...

        urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()

   More info and background on this can be found at
   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#staticfiles-development-view

#. Run `python manage.py syncdb` to add turrentine's tables to your database.

#. Back in settings.py, define a `TURRENTINE_TEMPLATE_ROOT`. This is the directory on
   your filesystem you keep most of your templates (generally $PROJECT_ROOT/templates).
   The following will probably work for your project::

    import os.path
    PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    TURRENTINE_TEMPLATE_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'templates')
    TURRENTINE_TEMPLATE_SUBDIR = os.path.join(TURRENTINE_TEMPLATE_ROOT, 'cms')

#. Create a directory for your CMS templates, corresponding to the setting you
   made in the previous step::

    mkdir -p templates/cms

#. Create template(s) in your `CMS_TEMPLATE_ROOT`, so they can be used by your pages.
   You'll probably want to use the following template variables (which are hopefully
   self-explanatory):

    - `{{ page.title }}`
    - `{{ page.content }}`
    - `{{ page.meta_description }}`
    - `{{ page.meta_keywords }}`


The Name
---------

In fine django tradition, turrentine is named after a jazz musician, the late
great tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine. Nicknamed "The Sugar Man",
Turrentine was famous for his bluesy feel and big sound. Check out his album
"Hustlin'", and his classic recordings with organist Jimmy Smith.
